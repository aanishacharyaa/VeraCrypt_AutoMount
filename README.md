# VeraCrypt_AutoMount
This Bash script automates the mounting of VeraCrypt volumes from external drives using their PARTUUIDs. It detects connected devices, checks if they're already mounted, prompts for passwords, and creates necessary mount points. The script provides clear feedback on actions taken, streamlining access to securely encrypted data.
